	<p>This course is designed to introduce programming concepts and tools that are commonly used in data science projects. The course covers a wide range of topics, from basic programming skills in Python to advanced machine learning techniques.</p>
	<h2>Introduction to Course</h2>
	<p>In this course, the fundamental concepts of programming and data science, including data manipulation, visualization, and modeling. I learnt how to use Python programming language to implement machine learning algorithms and build predictive models.</p>
	<h2>Python and Machine Learning</h2>
	<p>The course covers the basics of Python programming language and its application in data science. How to manipulate data using NumPy and Pandas, visualize data using Matplotlib and Seaborn, and build machine learning models using Scikit-learn library.</p>
	<h2>Using Regression Techniques</h2>
	<p>Regression analysis is a statistical technique used to analyze the relationship between two or more variables. How to implement linear and logistic regression techniques in Python to model relationships between variables and make predictions.</p>
	<h2>Support Vector Machines</h2>
	<p>Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a popular machine learning technique used for classification and regression analysis.I learnt how to implement SVMs in Python and use them for classification and regression tasks.</p>
	<h2>Decision Trees</h2>
	<p>Decision Trees are a simple yet powerful machine learning technique used for classification and regression analysis.I learnt how to implement decision trees in Python and use them for classification and regression tasks.</p>
	<h2>Ensemble Techniques</h2>
	<p>Ensemble Techniques are a group of machine learning techniques that combine multiple models to improve their performance.How to implement ensemble techniques, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, in Python and use them for classification and regression tasks.</p>
	<h2>CNN, RNN, DNN</h2>
	<p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are advanced machine learning techniques used for image classification, natural language processing, and other complex tasks. In this section, you will learn how to implement these techniques in Python and use them for various applications.</p>
	<h2>Text Mining</h2>
	<p>Text mining is the process of extracting useful information from unstructured textual data.learnt how to use Python to preprocess text data, extract features, and build models for text classification and sentiment analysis.</p>
	<h2>Autoencoder</h2>
	<p>Autoencoders are a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction.Learnt how to implement autoencoders in Python and use them for various applications.</p>
